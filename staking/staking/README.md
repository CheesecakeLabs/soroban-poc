# Staking contract

This is a contract that allows users to stake tokens inside a contract and earn reward tokens.

There is only one type of user, who needs to approve the contract to stake the token. The user earn some fee based on the time staked. This fee is payed with rewards token, so it's important the contract have the amount of this reward token to be paid.

The staking token and the reward token are represented by an ERC20 token.

The basic flow of use of the contract is illustrated bellow.
